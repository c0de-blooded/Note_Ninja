## How The Program Works

Note-Ninja is a program made to retrieve important information from lecture slides (pdf format only for now) and assemble it into one output file that the user can download and use as a summary guide for the provided set of slides. The program accepts a file as an input (the file must be a pdf). Once the file is uploaded, the submit button is pressed, and then, the summary file is generated, and downloaded by the user.

## Running The Program

- To run the program, ensure that all dependencies are installed. If not, install the required dependancies.
- Next, in the console, run the command `python app.py` and open your browser at the address `localhost://5000` (alternatively, follow the link given in the console).
- On the page that appears, click the "upload file" button to browse for a file to upload.
- Once the file has uploaded, clikc the button labeled "submit file" to submit the file to get processed by the program.
- Once the program has finished executing, the page will get redirected and will automatically download the new summary file.

If the program is accessed through GitHub Pages, none of this is required, only the actions to `upload` and `submit` the files are required.
